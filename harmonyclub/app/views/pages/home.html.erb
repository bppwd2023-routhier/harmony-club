The Club holds monthly meetings at O'Connor's Restaurant in Worcester with guest speakers. The Club also sponsors other cultural/social/sport events, tours, adult and children's 
Christmas parties. Members can participate in our golf league that takes place at Bed Rock Golf Club in Rutland, MA.</p>
